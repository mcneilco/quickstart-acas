# quickstart-dotmatics
## Dotmatics Suite on AWS

This Quick Start deploys the Dotmatics suite of informatics products on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.

The Dotmatics suite provides a fully integrated set of informatics tools to handle data management, analysis, reporting, and visualization for drug discovery, fine chemicals and agrochemicals, formulations, consumer packaged goods, foods, beverages, or fragrances.

The Quick Start deploys Dotmatics into the infrastructure set up by the [Biotech Blueprint core Quick Start](https://fwd.aws/mnWqP). You can also use the Quick Start to deploy Dotmatics into a new, empty virtual private cloud (VPC) or into your existing VPC.

This Quick Start is for teams or individuals who are responsible for managing informatics and research infrastructure for a biotech company. Whether your company is new to the cloud or has some existing cloud infrastructure, this Quick Start provides the informatics software your researchers need, and implements it by following industry best practices.
